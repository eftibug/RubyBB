    ### About
    RubyBB is a free bulletin board system.
    It is released under the [BSD-2-clause license](https://github.com/RubyBB/RubyBB#bsd-2-clause-license).
    You can either install it by yourself or fire freely your RubyBB through RubyBB.com.

    ### How does it works
    Go to to anything.rubybb.com: it will magically create a new empty forum!
    The first registered user will be its administrator.
    This new forum will have its own theme and its own set of users, categories, topics and messages.
    You own a domain name? Bind whatever.yourdomain.com to [www.rubybb.com](http://www.rubybb.com/), it will just work.

    ### Privacy
    You can delete all things you created with RubyBB:

    * as a user, you can delete your messages, comments, topics and account.
    * as an administrator, you can delete anything and
      access to the history of messages' edits as long as they are not deleted.

    ### Spam control
    A user can't post more than one message before the administrator's manual confirmation of its account.
    Nobody will be able to post more than one message or comment every ten seconds.

    ### Features
    * comment messages for small talks under each message.
    * follow message/topic/forum/user to be notified in real-time for news your are waiting for.
    * preview what your are writing in real-time: what you see is what you post.
    * browser crash? your message is autosaved while your are tiping.
    * awesome search engine: wildcard, exclusion, sentences, meta...
    * log in with Facebook or Google.
    * autolink things with #hashtag and @username in your messages.
    * renaming category and topics won't break anything: old links will redirect to the new ones.
    * RSS in each category and each topic.
    * custom your CSS!
